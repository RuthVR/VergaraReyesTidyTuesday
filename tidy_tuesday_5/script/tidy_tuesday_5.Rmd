# Introduction 
This is the 5th TidyTuesday that I have done. The data this week involves voting results from the United Nations. 


# Load Libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytuesdayR)
library(here)
library(calecopal)
library(lubridate)
```


# Load Data
```{r, message =FALSE}
tidydata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2021, week = 13)
issues <- tidydata$issues
roll_calls <- tidydata$roll_calls
unvotes <- tidydata$unvotes
```

# Data Analysis 

### Cleaning up the data
```{r}
rollcall_clean <- roll_calls %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(date)) %>%                         ### how I got all of them in correct date format
  mutate(year = year(date))                            ###  how I extracted the year from the date

Roll_vote_data <- inner_join(rollcall_clean,unvotes)   ### How I put together two data sets

countries <- c("United States","Russia","Sweden",
               "Norway","Mexico","Cuba")               ### How I got the countries that I want to look at 

FullData <- inner_join(Roll_vote_data,issues)%>%       ### How I got all the data sets together
  select(-date, -unres, -short,-descr,
         -short_name,-country_code, -importantvote)%>% ### How I got rid of columns I won't be using.
  filter(complete.cases(.))%>%                         ### filters out everything that is not a complete row
  filter(country %in% countries)

```


### Making the Plot
```{r}
ggplot(data = FullData,
       mapping = aes(x = year,
                     y = country,
                     color = vote,
                     fill = vote))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~issue)+
  theme_classic()+
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "",
       title = "How Countries have voted while in the UN",
       subtitle = "This plot shows how the following countries voted for the different issues
       between 1946-1984")+  ### new labels ##
  theme(legend.box = "none",
        axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
        title = element_text(size = 16),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11),
        legend.position = "bottom")+
  scale_color_manual(values = cal_palette("chaparral1"))

ggsave(here("tidy_tuesday_5", "output", "voting.png"),
       width = 10, height = 7)  

```
